MitoFractal is a repository for Fitri Ferdania's project with Fabian Spill, Sabrina Kombrink, Anthony Samuel, and Kiran Dhillon. It contains four main files:
  1. Animated_BCM_sample.m -> A MATLAB code to calculate the box-counting dimension of mitochondria fluorescence images. A sample of fluorescence image is given in the %076HCCCocl2Pax20024h.czi-HCCCocl2Pax20024h-0001.tif file. This code outputs the box-counting dimension, log-log plot, and animation for the box-counting method.
  2. %076HCCCocl2Pax20024h.czi-HCCCocl2Pax20024h-0001.tif -> a sample of the mitochondria fluorescence image.
  3. BCM_sample.m -> A MATLAB code to calculate the box-counting dimension of an image. This code outputs the box-counting dimension and log-log plot.
  4. Kochsnowflake_402x464.jpg -> a sample of fractal image known as Koch Snowflake with 402x464 pixels size.
